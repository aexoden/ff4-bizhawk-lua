# FF4 Bizhawk Lua

This is a collection of Lua scripts for the BizHawk emulator designed to help
the user analyze data from Final Fantasy IV.

## Prerequisites

The scripts are tested with BizHawk 2.2.2. If they happen to work with an
earlier version, it is sheer chance. I will not attempt to support older
versions and new useful features will be used as soon as they become available.

## Usage

Load Final Fantasy IV and then load the desired scripts in the Lua console. They
may be too CPU intensive in some cases to continue to run the game at full
speed depending on your machine.
